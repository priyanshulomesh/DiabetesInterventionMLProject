## Introduction

Diabetes is a prevalent chronic disease that affects millions of people worldwide. Early detection and prediction of diabetes can significantly improve patient outcomes. This project aims to provide a predictive tool that assesses the probability of an individual having diabetes based on certain input parameters.

## Usage

1. Make sure you have activated your virtual environment.
2. Run the Streamlit app: `streamlit run app.py`
3. The app should open in your default web browser.

## DataSet
It contains information on various health parameters such as pregnancies, blood glucose level, blood pressure, skin thickness, insulin level, BMI, diabetes pedigree function, and age.

## Machine Learning Model

The predictive model employs a machine learning algorithm trained on the provided dataset. The model has undergone rigorous testing and fine-tuning to ensure accurate predictions.

## Streamlit App

The heart of this project is the Streamlit web application, which provides a user interface for users to input their health parameters and obtain a diabetes prediction. The app is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly.
